EvalNE is an open source Python library designed for assessing and comparing the performance of Network Embedding (NE) methods on Link Prediction (LP), Sign Prediction (SP), Network Reconstruction (NR), 
Node Classification (NC) and vizualization downstream tasks. The library intends to simplify these complex and time consuming evaluation processes by providing automation and abstraction of tasks such as model hyper-parameter tuning and model validation, node and edge sampling, node-pair 
embedding computation, results reporting and data visualization, among many others.
EvalNE can be used both as a command line tool and as an API and is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3. 
In its current version, EvalNE can evaluate weighted directed and undirected simple networks.
